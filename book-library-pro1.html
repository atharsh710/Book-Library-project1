                <p>Apophis - Into the Folds of Darkness is the first novel in The Kleos Chronicles by <b>Raj Anand</b>. Pure chaos is approaching Earth. A danger unlike any other is moving towards the planet, and Earth is not prepared to fight the magnitude of the trouble coming its way. The brightest minds of the world are baffled by the fact that something this enormous is traveling towards Earth at breakneck speed. They named it Apophis because of its chaos-inducing properties. The only ones who can save the planet are not ready for the responsibility. These five saviors of the world live in different cities, and each of them has a path to follow. They are reincarnations of their past selves, and they carry the wisdom of the past too. Now all they need to do is save the world from the oncoming danger</p>
                    <p><b>Apophis - Into the Folds of Darkness</b> is a detailed novel. The narrative is descriptive, and you can tell that Raj Anand enjoyed writing the descriptions. There are a lot of characters in the story, so it is a little overwhelming at first, but it gets better as the reader gets more familiar with the characters. The concept is different, original, and very YA friendly. <b>Raj Anand</b> adds the right amount of pressure, mystery, and even mysticism to draw readers in and make them stay until the end. Claire proves to be the character that drives the story forward and gives readers an anchor to hold on to as the story progresses. The alien invasion trope is used, but the ending is surprising and something I did not anticipate. It is a good book, very unique and entertaining.</p>

                <p>It is said that fact is sometimes stranger than fiction, and nowhere is that more true than in the case of black holes. Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science fiction writers. In 2016 Professor <b>Stephen Hawking</b> delivered the BBC Reith Lectures on a subject that fascinated him for decades – black holes. In these flagship lectures the legendary physicist argued that if we could only understand black holes and how they challenge the very nature of space and time, we could unlock the secrets of the universe.</p>
                    <p>According to Hawking when a star dies, all of its mass collapses into a single point of infinite density (singularity) which leads to the formation of a black hole.We have reconsidered the black hole information paradox in light of recent insights into the infrared structure of quantum gravity. An explicit description has been given of a few of the pixels in the holographic plate at the future boundary of the horizon. Some information is accessibly stored on these pixels in the form of <b>soft photons and gravitons</b>. A complete description of the holographic plate and resolution of the information paradox remains an open challenge, which we have presented new and concrete tools to address.”</p>

                <p><b>Ross Welford’s newest book</b> takes us on an adventure across the galaxy. When twelve-year-old Ethan goes in search for his twin sister Tammie, he finds himself strangely relying on the help of his friend Iggy, a chicken called Suzy and an alien called Hellyann.</p>
                    <p><b>The shortness of the chapters makes this book a real page-turner - easy to access and hard to put down</b>. Lovers of science-fiction will enjoy the many links and nods to a range of space and UFO-themed works. 
                        Hellyann, the alien, is a superbly relatable character too, who seems to encourage the reader to look from alternative perspectives. The use of dual narration is important in allowing the reader to see through both Ethan and Hellyann’s eyes and quickly enables the reader to identify with both. </p>
                            <p>From the outset of this book, I was engaged with the story and cared about the characters. <b>'The Kid Who Came From Space'</b> is another superb story from Ross Welford, who always seems to deliver when it comes to fast-paced tales with humor and heart in equal measure.</p>

                <b><p>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</b>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins</p>
                    <p>From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest</p>
                        <p>The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider. </p>

                                <p>The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy trilogy written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor <b>J.R.R. Tolkien</b>. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier, less complex children's fantasy novel The Hobbit (1937), but eventually developed into a much larger work which formed the basis for the extended Middle-Earth Universe. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War II. It is the <b>third best-selling novel ever written, with over 150 million copies sold</b>.</p>

                <p>The hero-narrator of <b>The Catcher in the Rye</b> is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. 
                    There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.</p>

            <p> The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. 
                The other passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect?</p>
                    <p> Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, <b>Brit Bennett</b> produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing.
                        Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins.</p>

                <p><b>A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making—from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy </b> In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, <b>Barack Obama</b> tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency—a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil.</p>
                    <p><b>A Promised Land</b> is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, 
                        and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.</p>

                <p><b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b> wrote the book <b>‘The Discovery of India’</b>, during his imprisonment at Ahmednagar fort for participating in the Quit India Movement (1942 – 1946). The book was written during Nehru’s four years of confinement to solitude in prison and is his way of paying an homage to his beloved country and its rich culture.</p>
                    <p>The book started from ancient history, Nehru wrote at length of Vedas, Upanishads and textbooks on ancient time and ends during the British raj. The book is a broad view of Indian history, culture and philosophy, the same can also be seen in the television series. The book is considered as one of the <b>finest writing in Indian History</b>. The television series Bharat Ek Khoj which was released in 1988 was based on this book.</p>

                <p>Born against a background of privation and civil war, divided along lines of caste, class, language and religion, independent India emerged, somehow, as a united and democratic country. <b>Ramachandra Guha’s</b> hugely acclaimed book tells the full story – the pain and the struggle, the humiliations and the glories – of the world’s largest and least likely democracy.</p>
                    <p>While India is sometimes the most exasperating country in the world, it is also the most interesting. <b>Ramachandra Guha</b> writes compellingly of the myriad protests and conflicts that have peppered the history of free India. Moving between history and biography, the story of modern India is peopled with extraordinary characters. Guha gives fresh insights into the lives and public careers of those long-serving Prime Ministers, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. But the book also writes with feeling and sensitivity about lesser-known (though not necessarily less important) Indians – peasants, tribals, women, workers and musicians.</p>
                        <p>Massively researched and elegantly written, <b>India After Gandhi</b> is a remarkable account of India’s rebirth, and a work already hailed as a masterpiece of single volume history. This tenth anniversary edition, published to coincide with seventy years of India’s independence, is revised and expanded to bring the narrative up to the present.</p>

                <p>A native of Bombay, <b>Suketu Mehta</b> gives us an insider’s view of this stunning metropolis. He approaches the city from unexpected angles, taking us into the criminal underworld of rival Muslim and Hindu gangs, following the life of a bar dancer raised amid poverty and abuse, opening the door into the inner sanctums of Bollywood, and delving into the stories of the countless villagers who come in search of a better life and end up living on the sidewalks.</p> 
                    <p>As each individual story unfolds, Mehta also recounts his own efforts to make a home in Bombay after more than twenty years abroad. Candid, impassioned, funny, and heartrending, <b>Maximum City</b> is a revelation of an ancient and ever-changing world.</p>

                <p>On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues.</p>
                    <p>As <b>Truman Capote</b> reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. <b>In Cold Blood</b> is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.</p>

                <p><b>The New 52</b> is a 2011 DC Comics event marking the relaunch of its entire line with the publication of 52 new comic series, all beginning at #1. In September, 2011, <b>DC Comics</b> consolidated and relaunched their comic lines, discontinuing some series, and introducing yet other series, resulting in 52 titles, each with a new #1. That consolidation included the incorporation of both the Wildstorm Productions and the reincorporation of certain Vertigo properties into the mainstream DC Universe.
                    The event takes its name from the company's thematic associations with the number 52, which began with the publication of the weekly series 52, in which it was revealed that a Multiverse of 52 parallel realities existed within the DC Universe.</p>
                        <p>This September, DC Entertainment is making history by launching 52 <b>#1 DC Comics issues starring the World’s Greatest Super-Heroes</b>.

                <p><b>Will Eisner was present at the dawn of comics</b>. In the 1940s, he pushed the boundaries of the medium with his acclaimed weekly comic strip The Spirit, and with the publication of <b>A Contract with God</b> in 1978, he created a new medium altogether: the graphic novel. It was unlike anything seen before, heralding an era when serious cartoonists were liberated from the limiting confines of the comic strip.</p> 
                    <p>Eisner considered himself “a graphic witness reporting on life, death, heartbreak, and the never-ending struggle to prevail.” <b>A Contract with God</b> begins with a gripping tale that mirrors the artist’s real-life tragedy, the death of his daughter. Frimme Hersh, a devout Jew, questions his relationship with God after the loss of his own beloved child.</p>
                        <p>This centennial edition showcases Eisner’s singular visual style in new high-resolution scans of his original art, complete with an introduction by <b>Scott McCloud</b> and an illuminating history of Eisner’s seminal work. Now readers can experience the legendary book that launched a unique art form and reaffirmed <b>Will Eisner as one of the great pioneers of American graphic storytelling</b>.</p>

                <p><b>Marvel</b> presents the origins and history of its most famous creations. Narrated by <b>Stan (the Man) Lee</b>, that stellar storyman who saw comics as more than dime-store material and turned his characters into 20th-century mythology.</p>
                    <p>Included are the beginnings of <b>The Fantastic Four</b>, which hurled Marvel out of the area of monsters without soul into the age of cosmic heroes; <b>The Hulk</b>, brilliant scientist turned muddled monster; <b>Spider-Man</b>, the teenage superhero known affectionately to aficionados as "Spidey"; <b>Thor</b>, the surgeon turned Norse god with the mystical hammer and the Shakespearean speech pattern; and finally <b>Dr. Strange</b>, the oddball magician who uses his Satanic powers on the side of good.</p>
                        <p>After you read the big full-color stories and learn about the first heady inspirations from Stan, you will see why <b>Origins of Marvel Comics</b> stands alone as one of the great classics - an undying tribute to Marvel mania. </p>

                <p>The author <b>Malik Sajad</b>, uses Hangul, an endangered species of the Red Deer family, aborigine to Kashmir, as a powerful symbol,   to depict the plight Kashmiris. This is a staunch yet a subtle symbol exemplifying the signification of the <b>Kashmiri populace</b>: be it their existence, mindset, cultural symbols, ethos, or their homeland, that is constantly threatened and endangered.</p>        
                    <p>The large eyes of the characters are a representation of the dilemmas, trauma, and conflicts that an ordinary resident of the Valley faces in his daily life, within himself and while interacting with his surroundings and reality.The author has candidly and deftly used the power of his pen and canvas to paint the barbed, bloodied and beautiful picture of Kashmir to the eyes and hearts willing to spare a thought and concern for Kashmir.</p>
